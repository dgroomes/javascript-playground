## Design

Webpack has steadily grown over the years since its inception in 2012 (!) to become an extensive "software building
machine" for web-based projects. As such, I would like to create a working example of a webpack-based project in 2021.
The project will use TypeScript. I like plain JavaScript too, but for the sake of a webpack example project, it's
interesting to splice in TypeScript which requires a compilation build step.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run the project.

1. Install dependencies
   * `npm install`
3. Build the project continuously and serve the output:
   * `npm run start`
   * The project is ready to be viewed in the browser! The browser should open automatically.
     

## Reference 

* [webpack guide for TypeScript](https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/)
  * Most of this example project is based on the excellent webpack guides.
