# npm-library-rollup

An example NPM-based library bundled with Rollup and an example NPM-based program that consumes it.

## Description

This example project is a translation of the `../npm-libary/` project with the addition of *bundling*. The library code
is bundled into a single file (`animals.mjs`) using Rollup.

I won't repeat the same README content that was already written in `../npm-library`. Please study the README in that
project to better understand this one.
