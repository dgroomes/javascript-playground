Miscellaneous JavaScript code. Learning by doing.


## Overview

This project defines miscellaneous JavaScript code that I used to learn and explore concepts and trivia that otherwise
couldn't be categorized in a non-miscellaneous way. Don't pay too much attention to this code. It's a form of scratchpad.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to run the program:

1. Run the program:
   * ```shell
     node string-highlighting.mjs
     ```
