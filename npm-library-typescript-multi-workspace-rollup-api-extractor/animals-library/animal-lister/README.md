# animal-lister

Enumerate a list of animals.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build the program distribution:

1. Pre-work 
    * You need to build `animal-names` first. Follow the instructions in the README of that project. Note: there has to
      be a way to express "please build the whole multi-workspace project" in one command. I'm hoping this is possible.
2. Use npm version 8.5.5 or later
3. Install the dependencies:
    * ```shell
      npm install
      ```
4. Transpile the TypeScript source code:
    * ```shell
      npm run transpile
      ```
