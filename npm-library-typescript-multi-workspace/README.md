# npm-library-typescript-multi-workspace

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

An example npm-based multi-workspace TypeScript library and an example npm-based program that consumes it.

## Description

I want a working example of a multi-workspace TypeScript project. I'm following the great example of this [2ality blog post: *Simple monorepos via npm workspaces and TypeScript project references*](https://2ality.com/2021/07/simple-monorepos.html).
