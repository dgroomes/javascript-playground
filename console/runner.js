// Unfortunately, we need to use the Promise-oriented programming model to run these example programs instead of the `await`
// operator. JavaScript does not allow the `async` operator to be used at the top-level. It would be great if it did.
// We must use Promises to schedule these functions so that they run in serial, one after the other. This programming model
// couples these function invocations together, by way of chaining promises with the "then" function. This, in my opinion,
// makes for code that is not as readable as procedural code using the `await` operator.
